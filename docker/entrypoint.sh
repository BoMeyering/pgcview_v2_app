# supercronic runs the scheduled cleanup commands (see docker/crontab) for the
# life of the container; gunicorn serves the app. Backgrounding supercronic and
# exec'ing gunicorn keeps gunicorn as PID 1, so it gets `docker stop`'s SIGTERM
# directly and shuts down cleanly instead of waiting out the grace period.

# Long-running SSE responses (image processing progress, Drive upload
# progress) hold a connection open for as long as that job takes. Gunicorn's
# default `sync` worker can't survive that: it only checks in with the
# arbiter between requests, so a single request running past --timeout gets
# SIGKILL'd mid-stream NO MATTER HOW HIGH --timeout is set — confirmed by
# testing a sync worker against a slow streaming response, which was killed
# partway through even with a generous timeout. `gthread` workers check in
# from a separate thread, so a worker actively streaming a slow response
# still gets reaped correctly if it's genuinely hung, without capping how
# long a legitimate large job can take. Tune GUNICORN_WORKERS/_THREADS for
# your concurrent-job load.
